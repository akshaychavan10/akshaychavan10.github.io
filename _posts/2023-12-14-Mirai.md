Mirai is an easy-rated box on Hack The Box. It involves exploiting default credentials to gain shell access and using `sudo` privileges to escalate to root. Additionally, there’s a forensic challenge to recover the root flag.

---

## Enumeration

As always, we start with an **Nmap scan** to identify open ports and services running on the target machine.

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-28 07:51 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.48
Host is up (0.43s latency).

```

From the Nmap scan, we can see several open ports:
- **Port 22**: SSH (OpenSSH 6.7p1)
- **Port 53**: DNS (dnsmasq 2.76)
- **Port 80**: HTTP (lighttpd 1.4.35)
- **Port 1285**: UPnP
- **Port 32400**: Plex Media Server

My first approach was to enumerate the web service running on **port 80** for more information.

## Exploring the Web Service

I visited the website hosted on port 80, but it didn’t return anything useful. To dig deeper, I used **Burp Suite** to inspect the HTTP requests and responses. After analyzing the response, I discovered that the server is hosting **Pi-hole**, a network-wide ad blocker.

Next, I decided to fuzz for directories using **ffuf** (a web fuzzing tool). I discovered the `/admin` directory, which hosts the Pi-hole admin panel.

```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u http://10.10.10.48/FUZZ
```

---

## Default Credentials

I searched for default credentials for Pi-hole on Google and found that the default username is `pi` and the default password is `raspberry`. However, when I tried these credentials on the admin panel login page, they didn’t work.

## Gaining Shell Access

After some research, I checked the **Pi-hole GitHub repository** and learned that Pi-hole uses a random password during setup. This meant I couldn’t use default credentials to log in to the admin panel. However, I decided to try the same credentials (`pi:raspberry`) on the SSH service (port 22), and it worked! I gained initial access to the system via SSH.

## Privilege Escalation to Root

Once I had access to the user account, the first thing I checked was whether the user had `sudo` privileges. Running `sudo -l` revealed that the user could execute any command as root using `sudo`. I escalated to a root shell using the following command:

```bash
sudo -i
```

## Forensic Challenge: Recovering the Root Flag

When I tried to read the `root.txt` file, I encountered a message indicating that the original `root.txt` file was missing and might be backed up on a USB stick.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

Output:
```
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```

To investigate, I used the `mount` command to list mounted devices. It showed that `/dev/sdb` was mounted at `/media/usbstick`.

```bash
mount
```

I navigated to `/media/usbstick` and found a file named `damit.txt`. This file contained a note from a user named James, explaining that he had accidentally deleted the `root.txt` file.

Since I had no prior experience with forensics, I used the `strings` command to recover the contents of the deleted `root.txt` file from the USB stick.

```bash
strings /dev/sdb | grep "root.txt"
```

This successfully revealed the root flag.

## Conclusion

Mirai was a fun and beginner-friendly box that involved:
1. Enumerating open ports and services.
2. Exploiting default credentials to gain SSH access.
3. Using `sudo` privileges to escalate to root.
4. Recovering a deleted file using basic forensic techniques.

This challenge was a great introduction to privilege escalation and basic forensics.
