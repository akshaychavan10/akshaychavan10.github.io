## Key Terms

**Plaintext** — Data before encryption or hashing, often text but not always as it could be a photograph or other file instead.

**Encoding** — This is NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible.

**Hash** — A hash is the output of a hash function. Hashing can also be used as a verb, “to hash”, meaning to produce the hash value of some data.

**Brute force** — Attacking cryptography by trying every differen
t password or every different key

**Cryptanalysis** — Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

## What is a Hash Function

- Hash functions differ from encryption. They lack a key and are designed to make it nearly impossible to reverse-engineer the input from the output.

- Hash functions process input data of any size and generate a fixed-size summary, known as a "digest." Predicting the output for a given input, or vice versa, is difficult. Good hashing algorithms are fast to compute but slow to reverse. Even a minor change in the input data results in a significant change in the output.

- The output of a hash function is typically raw bytes, which are then encoded using common formats like base 64 or hexadecimal. However, decoding these encoded outputs won't provide any meaningful information.

> why should i care ?
Hashing is widely used in cybersecurity, often behind the scenes. For instance, when you log into platforms like TryHackMe or your computer, hashing is used to verify your password. It's a crucial component, especially in password security.

### What's a hash collision ?

A hash collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same output from a hash function. While hash functions aim to minimize collisions, they're inevitable due to the pigeonhole effect. This effect means that with a limited number of possible outputs (pigeonholes) and an unlimited number of possible inputs (pigeons), collisions are bound to happen.

## Uses for Hashing
Hashing is used for 2 main purposes in Cyber Security. 

1. To verify integrity of data
2. for verifying passwords.

### Hashing for password verification

- Storing passwords in plain text is a security risk because if a database is compromised, attackers can easily access users' passwords. This becomes especially dangerous if users reuse passwords across different accounts, including sensitive ones like banking.

- The "rockyou.txt" password list, found in Kali Linux, originated from a data breach at a company providing widgets for MySpace. The passwords were stored in plaintext, resulting in over 14 million passwords being leaked.

- You can’t encrypt the passwords, as the key has to be stored somewhere. If someone gets the key, they can just decrypt the passwords.

- Hashing passwords instead of storing them in plaintext provides an added layer of security. By storing only the hash of the password, the actual passwords remain undisclosed in the event of a data breach. If a hacker gains access to the database, they would need to crack each password hash to determine the original password.

- Storing password hashes instead of plaintext passwords mitigates some risks, but if multiple users have the same password, their hashes will be identical. This makes it easier for attackers to gain access to multiple accounts if they crack one hash. Additionally, attackers can use "Rainbow tables" to break hashed passwords more efficiently.

**Rainbow Table** 

Rainbow tables are essentially lookup tables of hashes mapped to plaintext passwords, enabling quick identification of a password from its hash. They trade storage space for faster password cracking but require time to generate.

> Websites like Crackstation internally use HUGE rainbow tables to provide fast password cracking for hashes without salts. 

**Protecting against Rainbow tables** 

- To guard against rainbow table attacks, salts are added to passwords. These salts, randomly generated and unique to each user, are stored in the database.

- In theory, you could use the same salt for all users but that means that duplicate passwords would still have the same hash, and a rainbow table could still be created specific passwords with that salt.
## Recognising password hashes
- Unix style password hashes are very easy to recognise, as they have a prefix. The prefix tells you the hashing algorithm used to generate the hash. The standard format is $format$rounds$salt$hash.

- On Linux, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow.

- Windows passwords are hashed using NTLM.

- On Windows password hashes are stored in the SAM.

- A great place to find more hash formats and password prefixes is the hashcat example page, available [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes).

## Password Cracking

- You cant "Decrypt" password hashesh becuase they're not encrypted. 
- attackers must crack the hashes by hashing numerous inputs (like those in rockyou) and comparing them to the target hash, possibly incorporating the salt if present. 
- Tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper are commonly used for this purpose.

**Why Crack on GPUs?** 

Graphics cards, with their thousands of cores, excel at certain mathematical tasks involved in hash functions. This makes them highly efficient for cracking most hash types much faster than CPUs alone. However, some algorithms like bcrypt are specifically designed to resist GPU-based cracking by ensuring that hashing on a GPU is comparably slow to hashing on a CPU.

## Hashing for Integrity Checking

- Hashing serves as a powerful tool for integrity checking, ensuring files remain unaltered. Even a single change in the data results in a significantly different hash output. This property enables verification of file integrity, detection of modifications, and confirmation of accurate downloads. Additionally, hashing facilitates the identification of duplicate files by comparing their hash values.

- HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) employs cryptographic hashing to authenticate and ensure data integrity. For instance, the TryHackMe VPN utilizes HMAC-SHA512 for message authentication. HMACs verify both the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the message, utilizing a secret key and a hashing algorithm to generate a secure hash.
