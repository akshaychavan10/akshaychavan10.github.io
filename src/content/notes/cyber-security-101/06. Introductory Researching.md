## Introduction
Effective research is crucial for hackers. Hacking demands deep knowledge, but nobody knows everything. Research helps solve problems by providing answers you don't have.

As you gain experience, research challenges grow, especially in information security. But even at expert levels, you'll always need to search for answers. 

We will be looking at the following topics:
• An example of a research question
• Vulnerability Searching tools
• Linux Manual Pages

**Methodology** : *Start with a question; get an initial understanding of the topic; then look into more advanced aspects as needed.* 

## Vulnerability Searching

**Where to Find Exploit For Specific Software.** 

-  [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) ExploitDB is a database of exploits and vulnerabilities in software

-  [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) NVD (National Vulnerability Database) is a US government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. 

-  [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities, maintained by MITRE.

## Manual Pages

One of the many useful features of Linux is the inbuilt `man` command, which gives you access to the manual pages for most tools directly inside your terminal.
