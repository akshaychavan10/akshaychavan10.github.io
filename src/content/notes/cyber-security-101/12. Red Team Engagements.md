## Introduction
For a successful project, good planning and clear communication are essential.
Types of red team engagements include:

- Tabletop exercises
- Adversary emulation
- Physical assessment

Learning Goals:

- Understand what makes up a red team engagement.
- Learn how to plan an engagement based on available resources and tactics.
- Know how to write documentation that meets client goals.

## Defining Scope and Objectives

- Engagements can be complex and bureaucratic. To succeed, clear client goals are essential. These goals should be discussed with the red team to ensure mutual understanding. Defined objectives form the basis for all planning and documentation.

- Without clear objectives, the campaign will be unstructured. Objectives set the tone for the engagement.

- When planning, decide how focused the assessment should be. Engagements can range from a general internal/network penetration test to a focused adversary emulation, targeting specific threats relevant to the client's industry.

- The approach depends on the client's objectives, which also influence the rules and scope of the engagement.

- These topics will be discussed in Task 6. Client objectives provide a basic framework, while specific plans will detail the engagement further. This will be covered later in this session.

**Keystone for Engagement: Well-Defined Scope**

- Scope varies by organization, based on infrastructure and posture.
- Defines what you can and cannot do or target.
- Set only by the client, not the red team.
- Red team can discuss concerns if the scope impacts the engagement.
- Must understand the network and assessment implications.

**Example Scope Language:**

- No data exfiltration.
- Production servers are off-limits.
- 10.0.3.8/18 is out of scope.
- 10.0.0.8/20 is in scope.
- No system downtime allowed.
- Exfiltration of PII is prohibited.

## Rules of Engagement

**Rules of Engagement (RoE):**

- Legally binding document outlining client objectives, scope, and engagement expectations.
- First official document in engagement planning, requiring authorization from both client and red team.
- Acts as the general contract; can be supplemented by external contracts or NDAs.
- Critical to have precise wording and format, as it sets clear expectations and is legally binding.

Below is a brief table of standard sections you may see contained in the RoE.

## Campaign Planning

- Builds on client objectives and Rules of Engagement (RoE).
- Details what the red team will do.
- Each red team has its own methods and documents for planning.
- We'll show a detailed set of plans for clear communication and documentation.
- The campaign summary includes four plans, adapted from military operations, explained in the table below.

| **Type of Plan** | **Explanation of Plan**                                                          | **Plan Contents**                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Engagement Plan  | An overarching description of technical requirements of the red team.            | CONOPS, Resource and Personnel Requirements, Timelines       |
| Operations Plan  | An expansion of the Engagement Plan. Goes further into specifics of each detail. | Operators, Known Information, Responsibilities, etc.         |
| Mission Plan     | The exact commands to run and execution time of the engagement.                  | Commands to run, Time Objectives, Responsible Operator, etc. |
| Remediation Plan | Defines how the engagement will proceed after the campaign is finished.          | Report, Remediation consultation, etc.                       |


Another example of a campaign plan is the [redteam.guide](http://redteam.guide/) engagement checklist. The checklist, found [here](https://redteam.guide/docs/checklists/red-team-checklist/), acts as a more generalized approach to planning a campaign and information needed.

## Engagement Documentation

- Engagement documentation extends campaign planning by officially recording ideas and plans. "Document" can be misleading, as some plans might just be emails. 
- This task provides a technical overview of each campaign plan's contents, with detailed plans and documents covered in upcoming tasks.

**Engagement Plan:**

| **Component**                  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                       |

| Remediation/consultation | How will the client remediate findings? It can be included in the report or discussed in a meeting between the client and the red team. |

## Concept of Operations

The Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is a part of the engagement plan that provides a high-level overview, similar to an executive summary in a penetration test report. It serves as a reference for both the client and the red team to build on for further planning.

The CONOPS should be written in a semi-technical way, assuming the reader has little to no technical knowledge. While it should be high-level, it should still include details like common tools and target groups. There is no set standard for a CONOPS, but it should include the following key components:

- Client Name
- Service Provider
- Timeframe
- General Objectives/Phases
- Other Training Objectives (Exfiltration)
- High-Level Tools/Techniques planned to be used
- Threat group to emulate (if any)

## Resource Plan

The resource plan is the second document of the engagement plan, detailing a brief overview of dates, knowledge required (optional), resource requirements. The plan extends the CONOPS and includes specific details, such as dates, knowledge required, etc.

Unlike the CONOPS, the resource plan should not be written as a summary; instead, written as bulleted lists of subsections.

- Header
    - Personnel writing
    - Dates
    - Customer
- Engagement Dates
    - Reconnaissance Dates
    - Initial Compromise Dates
    - Post-Exploitation and Persistence Dates
    - Misc. Dates
- Knowledge Required (optional)
    - Reconnaissance
    - Initial Compromise
    - Post-Exploitation
- Resource Requirements
    - Personnel
    - Hardware
    - Cloud
    - Misc.

## Operations Plan

The operations plan is a flexible document that details the specific actions and information for the engagement, expanding on the CONOPS. It can also include the Rules of Engagement (ROE).

It should use bulleted lists and small subsections for clarity, similar to the resource plan. There is no standard template, but here are example subsections:

- Header
    - Personnel writing
    - Dates
    - Customer
- Halting/stopping conditions (can be placed in ROE depending on depth)
- Required/assigned personnel
- Specific TTPs and attacks planned
- Communications plan
- Rules of Engagement (optional)

The most notable addition to this document is the communications plan. The communications plan should summarize how the red cell will communicate with other cells and the client overall. list of possible options a team will choose to communicate :

- [victr.io](https://vectr.io) 
- Email
- Slack

## Mission Plan

The mission plan is a cell-specific document that details the exact actions to be completed by operators. The document uses information from previous plans and assigns actions to them.

Below is a list of the minimum detail that cells should include within the plan.

- Objectives
- Operators
- Exploits/Attacks
- Targets (users/machines/objectives)
- Execution plan variations
