## Introduction

The difference between `URL`s and `FQDN`s is that:

- an `FQDN` (`www.hackthebox.eu`) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- an `URL` (`https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17`) also specifies the "`floor`," "`office`," "`mailbox`" and the corresponding "`employee`" for whom the package is intended.

## Netowork Types

#### Common Terminology

| **Network Type**                   | **Definition**                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Wide Area Network (WAN)            | Internet                                     |
| Local Area Network (LAN)           | Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)       |
| Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) | Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi      |
| Virtual Private Network (VPN)      | Connects multiple network sites to one `LAN` |

#### WAN

-  a WAN is just a large number of LANs joined together. Many large companies or government agencies will have an "Internal WAN" (also called Intranet,
- The primary way we identify if the network is a WAN is to use a WAN Specific routing protocol such as BGP and if the IP Schema in use is not within RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).

> RFC 1918 : It defines a range of IP addresses that are reserved for use within private networks, which are not routable on the public internet. These addresses are commonly used for internal networks within organizations or for home networks.

>10.0.0.0/8 - This block allows for 16,777,216 IP addresses and is typically used by large organizations.

>172.16.0.0/12 - This block allows for 1,048,576 IP addresses and is often used in medium-sized networks.

>192.168.0.0/16 - This block allows for 65,536 IP addresses and is commonly used in home networks and small businesses.

#### LAN/WLAN

- LANs (Local Area Network) and WLANs (Wireless Local Area Network) will typically assign IP Addresses designated for local use (RFC 1918, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
- There's nothing different between a LAN or WLAN, other than WLAN's introduce the ability to transmit data without cables.

#### VPN

| SITE-TO-SITE VPN                                                                                                                         | REMOTE ACCESS VPN                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - establishes a secure connection between two separate networks, typically connecting two or more physical locations of an organization. | allows individual users to connect securely to a corporate network from a remote location, such as from their homes or while traveling. |

**Site-to-site vpn** 

allows multiple locations of an organization to establish secure connections over the internet, essentially creating a private network. This type of VPN is commonly used to connect branch offices to a central office, or to connect multiple data centers.
It allow multiple locations to communicate over the Internet as if they were local.

**Remote Access VPN** 

A remote access VPN is like a secret tunnel that lets your computer connect to another network securely over the internet. It's handy for accessing resources on a company's network from outside, like working from home or traveling

It create virtual interface. like in htb  we use openvpn which create TUN  interface. (`ifconfig`)

*split-tunnel* : A split-tunnel VPN is a type of virtual private network (VPN) connection that divides internet traffic into two separate paths, based on its destination.

- Regular internet traffic
- VPN traffic

**SSL VPN** 

This is essentially a VPN that is done within our web browser and is becoming increasingly common as web browsers are becoming capable of doing anything.

#### Book Terms 

| Network Type                          | Definition                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Global Area Network (GAN)             | Global network (the Internet)    |
| Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)       | Regional network (multiple LANs) |
| Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) | Personal network (Bluetooth)     |

#### GAN

- A worldwide network such as the `Internet` is known as a `Global Area Network` (`GAN`).
- However , the internet is not the only computer network of this kind. large companies also maintain islolated network that span several WANs.

#### MAN

- broadband telecommunications network that connects several `LAN`s in geographical proximity.

#### PAN / WPAN

- Modern devices (laptops,computer,smarthome) can be connnected ad hoc to form network to enable data exchange. This can be done by cable in the form of a `Personal Area Network` (`PAN`).
- The wireless variant `Wireless Personal Area Network` (`WPAN`) is based on Bluetooth or Wireless USB technologies. A `wireless personal area network` that is established via Bluetooth is called `Piconet`

## Networking Topologies

- A `network topology` is a typical arrangement and `physical` or `logical` connection of devices in a network. 
- Computers are `hosts`, such as `clients` and `servers`, that actively use the network. 
- They also include `network components` such as `switches`, `bridges`, and `routers`
- The network topology determines the components to be used and the access methods to the transmission media.

We can divide the entire network topology area into three areas:

#### 1. Connections

| `Wired connections`  | `Wireless connections` |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Coaxial cabling      | Wi-Fi                  |
| Glass fiber cabling  | Cellular               |
| Twisted-pair cabling | Satellite              |
| and others           | and others             |

#### 2. Nodes - Network Interface Controller (NICs)

- Network nodes are the `transmission medium's connection points` to transmitters and receivers of electrical, optical, or radio signals in the medium.

| Repeaters    | HUBS     | Bridges   | Switches |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Router/Modem | Gateways | Firewalls |          |
#### 3. Classifications

We can imagine a topology as a virtual form or `structure of a network`.


| Point-to-Point | Bus         |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Star           | Ring        |
| Mesh           | Tree        |
| Hybrid         | Daisy Chain |

#### Point-to-Point

- In this topology, a direct and straightforward physical link exists only between `two hosts`.

#### Bus

- All hosts are connected via a transmission medium in the bus topology. 
- Every host has access to the transmission medium and the signals that are transmitted over it. 
- There is no central network component that controls the processes on it. The transmission medium for this can be, for example, a `coaxial cable`.

#### Ring

The `physical` ring topology is such that each host or node is connected to the ring with two cables:

- One for the `incoming` signals and
- the another for the `outgoing` ones.

#### Mesh

In simple terms, a mesh topology is a network design where every device in the network is connected to every other device. It forms a "mesh" of connections, creating multiple paths for data to travel between devices.

 There are two basic structures from the basic concept: the `fully meshed` and the `partially meshed` structure.

Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a `fully meshed structure`. This means that the hosts are meshed with each other.

In the `partially meshed structure`, the endpoints are connected by only one connection.

## Tree

The tree topology is an extended star topology that more extensive local networks have in this structure.

## Hybrid

Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies so that the resulting network does not present any standard topologies.

#### Daisy Chain Topology

daisy chain topology is a network architecture where each computer and network device is connected to the next device in a line or chain, forming a single continuous line. It resembles the arrangement of links in a daisy chain, hence the name

## Proxies

- A proxy is when a device or service sits in the middle of a connection and acts as a mediator. 
- The `mediator` is the critical piece of information because it means the device in the middle must be able to inspect the contents of the traffic. 
- Without the ability to be a `mediator`, the device is technically a `gateway`, not a proxy.

proxies will almost always operate at Layer 7 of the OSI Model. There are many types of proxy services, but the key ones are:

- `Dedicated Proxy` / `Forward Proxy`
- `Reverse Proxy`
- `Transparent Proxy`

1. **Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy**:
    
    - **Functionality**: A forward proxy, also known as a dedicated proxy, acts as an intermediary server between client devices (such as computers or mobile devices) and the internet. When a client device requests data from the internet, it first sends the request to the forward proxy server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the internet on behalf of the client, retrieves the requested data, and sends it back to the client.
        
    - **Usage**: Forward proxies are commonly used for various purposes, including enhancing security, improving performance, and controlling internet access within organizations. They can cache frequently requested content, filter web traffic based on predefined rules or policies, and hide the client's IP address from the destination server, providing anonymity and privacy.

2. **Reverse Proxy**:
    
    - **Functionality**: Unlike a forward proxy, a reverse proxy sits between the internet and a web server, acting as an intermediary for inbound client requests. When a client sends a request to access a web server, it first reaches the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server based on predefined rules, such as load balancing or content caching. Once the backend server processes the request, the reverse proxy sends the response back to the client.
        
    - **Usage**: Reverse proxies are commonly used to improve the performance, scalability, and security of web servers. They can distribute incoming client requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load, cache static content to reduce server load and latency, terminate SSL/TLS connections, and provide an additional layer of security by hiding the internal network structure and protecting against common web attacks.

3. **Transparent Proxy**:
    
    - **Functionality**: A transparent proxy intercepts and handles client requests without requiring any configuration changes on the client-side. Unlike traditional proxies where clients must explicitly configure their devices to use the proxy server, transparent proxies operate without the client's knowledge. They intercept network traffic at the network layer, often at the router or gateway level, and redirect it through the proxy server transparently.
        
    - **Usage**: Transparent proxies are commonly used by network administrators to enforce internet usage policies, filter web content, and optimize network performance without requiring client-side configuration. They can be implemented in various network devices, such as routers, firewalls, or caching servers, to intercept and modify network traffic transparently. However, transparent proxies may raise privacy concerns since users may not be aware that their web traffic is being intercepted and monitored.
