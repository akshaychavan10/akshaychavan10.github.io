## Network Layer

- The `network layer` (`Layer 3`) of `OSI` controls the exchange of data packets.
-  it is responsible for the following functions:
	- `Logical Addressing`
	- `Routing`
- The most used protocols on this layer are:
	- `IPv4` / `IPv6`
	- `IPsec`
	- `ICMP`
	- `IGMP`
	- `RIP`
	- `OSPF`

- It ensures the routing of packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet.

## IPv4 Addresses

#### IPv4 Structure

The most common method of assigning IP addresses is `IPv4`, which consists of a `32`-bit binary number combined into `4 bytes` consisting of `8`-bit groups (`octets`) ranging from `0-255`.

Thus an IPv4 address can look like this:

| **Notation** | **Presentation**                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Binary       | 0111 1111.0000 0000.0000 0000.0000 0001 |
| Decimal      | 127.0.0.1                               |

The IP network blocks were divided into `classes A - E`. The different classes differed in the host and network shares' respective lengths.

|**`Class`**|**Network Address**|**First Address**|**Last Address**|**Subnetmask**|**CIDR**|**Subnets**|**IPs**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|1.0.0.0|1.0.0.1|127.255.255.255|255.0.0.0|/8|127|16,777,214 + 2|
|`B`|128.0.0.0|128.0.0.1|191.255.255.255|255.255.0.0|/16|16,384|65,534 + 2|
|`C`|192.0.0.0|192.0.0.1|223.255.255.255|255.255.255.0|/24|2,097,152|254 + 2|
|`D`|224.0.0.0|224.0.0.1|239.255.255.255|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|
|`E`|240.0.0.0|240.0.0.1|255.255.255.255|reserved|reserved|reserved|reserved|


**subnet mask** : 

- The IP address is divided into a `host part` and a `network part`.
	- Host Part : which identifies the specific device on that network, assigned by router at home or by an administrator.
	- Network Part : identifies the network the device is on, respective network administrator assigns the network part.

- 32-bit number used in conjection with ip address to identify the `network part` and `host part` of the address.
- For example, the subnet mask "255.255.255.0" (often expressed in shorthand notation as "/24") has the first 24 bits set to 1, indicating that the first 24 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits represent the host portion.
- When an IP address and subnet mask are bitwise ANDed together, the result determines the network address.
	- For example, consider the IP address 192.168.1.100 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. In binary, the subnet mask would be 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. When bitwise ANDed with the IP address (11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100), the result (11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000) gives us the network address (192.168.1.0).

#### Broadcast Address 

- The `broadcast` IP address's task is to connect all devices in a network with each other. 
- `Broadcast` in a network is a message that is transmitted to all participants of a network and does not require any response. 
- In this way, a host sends a data packet to all other participants of the network simultaneously and, in doing so, communicates its `IP address`, which the receivers can use to contact it. This is the `last IPv4` address that is used for the `broadcast`.

|**Class**|**Network Address**|**First Address**|**`Last Address`**|**Subnetmask**|**CIDR**|**Subnets**|**IPs**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|1.0.0.0|1.0.0.1|`127.255.255.255`|255.0.0.0|/8|127|16,777,214 + 2|
|B|128.0.0.0|128.0.0.1|`191.255.255.255`|255.255.0.0|/16|16,384|65,534 + 2|
|C|192.0.0.0|192.0.0.1|`223.255.255.255`|255.255.255.0|/24|2,097,152|254 + 2|
|D|224.0.0.0|224.0.0.1|`239.255.255.255`|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|Multicast|
|E|240.0.0.0|240.0.0.1|`255.255.255.255`|reserved|reserved|reserved|reserved|

#### CIDR

- `Classless Inter-Domain Routing` (`CIDR`) is a method of representation and replaces the fixed assignment between IPv4 address and network classes (A, B, C, D, E).
- Let's say an organization needs 200 IP addresses. Instead of assigning a full class C block (which would provide 254 addresses, with many unused), CIDR allows them to request a block with just enough addresses for their needs.
- With CIDR, IP addresses are written in a format like this: 192.168.1.0/24. The number after the slash (/) indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the IP address.
- CIDR notation "192.168.1.0/24", the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, leaving 8 bits for the host portion.

## Subnetting

- the division of an address range of ipv4 addresses into several smaller address ranges is called subnetting.
- subnet is logical segment of a network that uses IP addresses with the same network address.

| CIDR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | SUBNETTING                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - Think of CIDR as a blueprint or map that outlines the boundaries of your entire piece of land. It tells you the total size of your land and how it's divided into different sections..                                                                                    | - Subnetting, on the other hand, is like taking your large piece of land and dividing it into smaller plots for specific purposes. It's about breaking down your overall network space into smaller, more manageable sections. |
| - For example, if your land is 100 acres in total, CIDR would tell you that your land is "100 acres" in size. This is similar to CIDR notation like "192.168.1.0/24", which tells you the total address range available and how it's divided into network and host portions | - For example, let's say you decide to divide your 100-acre land into smaller plots of 10 acres each. Each 10-acre plot represents a subnet. You might use one plot for building houses, another for farming, and so on.       |


**Lets take example and understand how subnetting works**

- IPv4 Address: `192.168.12.160`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.192`
- CIDR: `192.168.12.160/26`

- we know that ip address is divided into the` network part` (cannot be changed, fixed )and `host part.`(can be changed to first and last address. first address is network address  and last address is broadcast address.) this division is determined by subnet mask, which indicate how many bits are used for the network portion and how many bits are used for the host portion.

- *How to identify network part and host part of an ip address*
	- We need ip address and subnet mask to find out network part and host par.
	- *Example* : IP : 192.168.12.160 with subnet mask 255.255.255.192. 
	- First convet both ip address into binary.
	- `11000000.10101000.00001100.10100000` and
	- `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000` 
	- Perform a bitwise AND operation between the binary representations of the IP address and the subnet mask. This operation will give you the network address.

```bash
11000000.10101000.00001100.10100000 (192.168.12.160)
& 
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (255.255.255.192)
----------------------------------------------------------
11000000.10101000.00001100.10000000  (192.168.12.128)
```

	- if we look at subnet mask first `26` bits are represent `network part` and last 6 bit represent `host part`. 
	- Here 0.0.0.160 is the host part.

- **Network address** : important for delivery of data packets. if the network address is the same for the source and destination address, the data packet is delivered within the same subnet. if network addresses are different the data packet must be routed to another subnet via the default gateway.(usually a router).

- **How to find out network address and broadcast address** :
	- if we set all bits to `0` in `host part` of the ipv4 address we get respective subnet's network address.

| Subnet mask    | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `1111 1111`   | `11\|`00 0000 | 255.255.255.192     |

	- If we set all bits in the host part of the ipv4 address to 1 we get the braodcast address.

- **How to calculate available addresses in subnet** :
	- identify the subnet mask and covert it to binary.
	- count the number of host bits. (count the number of consecutive 0's after the last 1. this gives you the number of host bits.)
	- calculate the number of addresses using `2^ (number of host bits) - 2`
		- 2^6-2=62 ip address assigned to above subnet.

|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|
|---|---|---|---|
|/8|/16|/24|/32|

#### Subnetting into smaller networks
- we can only divide the subnets on the binary system.

|**Exponent**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|2`^0`|= 1|
|2`^1`|= 2|
|2`^2`|= 4|
|2`^3`|= 8|
|2`^4`|= 16|
|2`^5`|= 32|
|2`^6`|= 64|
|2`^7`|= 128|
|2`^8`|= 256|


## MAC Addresses

- Each host in a network has its own 48 bit (6 octets) Media access Control (mac).
- Its Physical Address.
- there are several different standard for mac address:
	- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
	- Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)
	- WLAN (IEEE 802.11)
- Each network card has its individual MAC address which configured while manufacturering , but can be changed for temporarily.

The first half (`3 bytes` / `24 bit`) is the so-called `Organization Unique Identifier` (`OUI`) defined by the `Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers` (`IEEE`) for the respective manufacturers.

|**Representation**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**5th Octet**|**6th Octet**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Binary|`1101 1110`|`1010 1101`|`1011 1110`|1110 1111|0001 0011|0011 0111|
|Hex|`DE`|`AD`|`BE`|EF|13|37|

The last half of the MAC address is called the `Individual Address Part` or `Network Interface Controller` (`NIC`), which the manufacturers assign. The manufacturer sets this bit sequence only once and thus ensures that the complete address is unique.

|**Representation**|**1st Octet**|**2nd Octet**|**3rd Octet**|**4th Octet**|**5th Octet**|**6th Octet**|

**Unicast**: In networking, a unicast transmission is a one-to-one communication between a single sender and a single receiver.

**Multicast**: Multicast transmission is a one-to-many communication method where a single sender sends data to a group of specific destination devices.

To determine whether a MAC address corresponds to a unicast or multicast address, you can examine the least significant bit (LSB) of the first byte (octet) of the MAC address.

If the LSB is 0, it indicates a unicast address, while if the LSB is 1, it indicates a multicast address.

Here's a breakdown:

- Unicast MAC addresses: The least significant bit (LSB) of the first byte (octet) is 0.
- Multicast MAC addresses: The least significant bit (LSB) of the first byte (octet) is 1.

| **Representation** | **1st Octet** | **2nd Octet** | **3rd Octet** | **4th Octet** | **5th Octet** | **6th Octet** |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Binary             | 1101 111`0`   | 1010 1101     | 1011 1110     | 1110 1111     | 0001 0011     | 0011 0111     |
| Hex                | D`E`          | AD            | BE            | EF            | 13            | 37            |

The second last bit in the first octet identifies whether its a global OUI, defined by the IEEE or a. locally administrated mac address.

Global OUI

#### Address Resolution Protocol

- Maps Host IP address to its corresponding MAC address to facilitate communication between devices on Local Area Network(lan).

**ARP Resolution** :
when device on LAN wants to communicate with another device, it send a broadcast message containing the destination IP address and its own mac address.

the device with matching IP address responds with its own mac address and two devices can then communicate directly using mac address.

This process is called ARP resolution.

## IPv6 Addresses

- `IPv6` address is `128` bit long.

There are four different types of IPv6 addresses:

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Unicast`|Addresses for a single interface.|
|`Anycast`|Addresses for multiple interfaces, where only one of them receives the packet.|
|`Multicast`|Addresses for multiple interfaces, where all receive the same packet.|
|`Broadcast`|Do not exist and is realized with multicast addresses.|
