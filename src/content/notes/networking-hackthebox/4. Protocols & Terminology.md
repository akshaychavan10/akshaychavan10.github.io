#### ICMP

- protocol used by devices to communicate with each other on the Internet for various purposes, including error reporting and status information. It sends requests and messages between devices, which can be used to report errors or provide status information.
**ICMP Requests** :  A request is message sent by one device to another to request information or perform a specific action . (ex: ping request test connectivity between two devices)

**ICMP Messages** : A messge in ICMP can be either a request or reply. (ex: ICMP used to share information about error such as destination unreachble or time exceeded.)

|**Request Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Echo Request`|This message tests whether a device is reachable on the network. When a device sends an echo request, it expects to receive an echo reply message. For example, the tools `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux) always send ICMP echo requests.|
|`Timestamp Request`|This message determines the time on a remote device.|
|`Address Mask Request`|This message is used to request the subnet mask of a device.|

| **Message Type**          | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Echo reply`              | This message is sent in response to an echo request message.                                                                     |
| `Destination unreachable` | This message is sent when a device cannot deliver a packet to its destination.                                                   |
| `Redirect`                | A router sends this message to inform a device that it should send its packets to a different router.                            |
| `time exceeded`           | This message is sent when a packet has taken too long to reach its destination.                                                  |
| `Parameter problem`       | This message is sent when there is a problem with a packet's header.                                                             |
| `Source quench`           | This message is sent when a device receives packets too quickly and cannot keep up. It is used to slow down the flow of packets. |
|                           |                                                                                                                                  |

**TTL (TIME TO LIVE)** : 
- TTL is header field in ICMP packets that limit the packets lifetime as it travels throught the network.
- Each time packet passes throught a router , the router decrements the TTL value by 1. when TTL reaches 0, the router discards and sends an ICMP `time exceeded` message back to the sender.


#### VoIP(Voice over internet protocol) 

- method of transmitting voice and multimedia commnucations. eg : allows us to make phone call using broadband internet connection instead of traditional phone line, like skype , whatsapp , slack , zoom etc.
- common VoIP prots are TCP/5060 and TCP/5061 which are used for the [Session Initiation Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) (SIP).
	- SIP is a signaling protocol for initiating, maintaining, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions involving video, voice, messaging.
	- The most common SIP requests and methods are:

| **Method** | **Description**                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `INVITE`   | Initiates a session or invites another endpoint to participate.                                                    |
| `ACK`      | Confirms the receipt of an INVITE request.                                                                         |
| `BYE`      | Terminate a session.                                                                                               |
| `CANCEL`   | Cancels a pending INVITE request.                                                                                  |
| `REGISTER` | Registers a SIP user agent (UA) with a SIP server.                                                                 |
| `OPTIONS`  | Requests information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agent, such as the types of media it supports. |

## Wireless Networks

- wireless networks use radio Frequency (RF) to transmit data between devices.
- each devices on network has a wireless adapter that convert data into RF singles and send them over air.
- other devices receive these signals with their own wireless adapters and the data is then converted back into usable form.
- Small area such as home or small office use wireless technology called WiFi , on the other hand  wireless wide area network (WWAN) might use mobile telecommunication technology such as 3G,4G LTE, 5G.
- Communication between devices occurs over RF in the `2.4 GHz` or `5 GHz` bands in a WiFi network.

#### Wifi Connection 

- to connect to router, lapto p uses a wireless netowrking protocol called IEEE 802.11. this protocol defines the technical details of how wireless devices communicate with each other and with WAPs.
- When device wants to connect to wifi network , it sends a request to WAP to initiate the connection process. This request is know as `connection request frame` or `association request`. and is sent using IEEE 802.11 protocol.
- In addition to the `IEEE 802.11` protocol, other networking protocols and technologies may also be used, like TCP/IP, DHCP, and WPA2, in a WiFi network to perform tasks such as assigning IP addresses to devices, routing traffic between devices, and providing security.

**WEP Challenge-Response Handshake** :

- Its protocol to establish a secure connection between WAP and client device.

|**Step**|**Who**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|1|`Client`|Sends an association request packet to the WAP, requesting access.|
|2|`WAP`|Responds with an association response packet to the client, which includes a challenge string.|
|3|`Client`|Calculates a response to the challenge string and a shared secret key and sends it back to the WAP.|
|4|`WAP`|Calculates the expected response to the challenge with the same shared secret key and sends an authentication response packet to the client.|

- Nevertheless, some packets can get lost, so the CRC checksum has been integrated.
- Cyclic Redundancy check (CRC) is an error detection mechanism used to protect against data corruption in wireless communication.
- First CRC value calculate for each packet based on packet's data, and when it reaches destination device , CRC value is recalculated and compared to original value.
- if its matches data transfered successfully without any errors. if not then needs to retransmitte the data.
- used to verify integrity of the data.

#### Security Features

**Encryption** : Common encryption algorith in WiFi networks are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2), and WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3).

**Access Control** : WiFi networks are configured by default to allow authorized devices to join the network using specific authentication methods. However, these methods can be changed by requiring a password or a unique identifier (such as a MAC address) to identify authorized devices.

**Firewall** : controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules.

#### Encryption Protocols.

> Here WAP is router and WEP & WPA is encryption protocols

**WEP** 

- wep uses 40-bit or 1040bit key to encrypt data, while wpa using AES uses a 128-bit key.Longer keys provide more robust encryption and are more resistant to attacks.

## VPN

several components and requirements are necessary for a VPN to work:

| **Requirement**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VPN Client`     | This is installed on the remote device and is used to establish and maintain a VPN connection with the VPN server. For example, this could be an OpenVPN client.        |
| `VPN Server`     | This is a computer or network device responsible for accepting VPN connections from VPN clients and routing traffic between the VPN clients and the private network.    |
| `Encryption`     | VPN connections are encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES and IPsec, to secure the connection and protect the transmitted data. |
| `Authentication` | The VPN server and client must authenticate each other using a shared secret, certificate, or another authentication method to establish a secure connection.           |

**IPsec**

- internet protocol security is a network protocl that provides encryption and authentication for internet communications. 
- Works by encrypting the data payload of each IP packet and adding an **authentication header (AH)** .
- IPsec uses two protocols to provide encryption and authentication
	- 1. Authentication Header (AH) : Provides integrity (data does not altered or tampered.) and authenticity (genuine source of origin of data) for IP packets. it adds AH to each IP packet, which contain cryptographic checksum
	- 2. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) : provides encryption and optional authentication for IP packets.
- IPsec can be used in two modes :

|**Mode**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Transport Mode`|In this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the data payload of each IP packet but does not encrypt the IP header. This is typically used to secure end-to-end communication between two hosts.|
|`Tunnel Mode`|With this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the entire IP packet, including the IP header. This is typically used to create a VPN tunnel between two networks.|

**PPTP** 

- [Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol](https://www.vpnranks.com/blog/pptp-vs-l2tp/) (`PPTP`) is also a network protocol that allows the creation of VPNs and works by establishing a secure tunnel between the VPN client and server and then encapsulating the data being transmitted within this tunnel.
