## key Exchange Mechanisms

- key exchange method used to exchange cryptographic keys between two parties.
- this typically works by allowing two parties to agree on a shared secret key over an insure channel.

**Diffie-Hellman** 

1. allow two parties to agree on a shared secret key without any prior communication or shared private information.
2. used as the basis for establishing secure communication channels, such as `TLS (Transport Layer Security` protocol that is used to protect web traffic.
3. But its vulnerable to MITM attacks.
4. Also require large amount of CPU power to generate shared keys.

**RSA** 

1. uses the properties of large prime numbers to generate a shared secret key.
2. This method relies on the fact that its relatively easy to multiply large prime numbers together but challenging to factor the resulting number back into its prime factors.

> what does it mean is : The security of RSA relies on the fact that it's very hard for someone to take  large number n (which is the product of two large prime numbers) and figure out what those two prime numbers p and q were. In other words, it's difficult for an attacker to factorize n back into its original prime factors p and q.

**ECDH** 

1. `Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman` is variant of Diffie-Hellman key exchangev that uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate screte key.

**ECDSA** 

1. `Elliptic Curve Digital Signarture Algorithm(ECDSA)` uses elliptric curve cryptography to generate digital signature that can authenticate parities.

|**Algorithm**|**Acronym**|**Security**|
|---|---|---|
|`Diffie-Hellman`|`DH`|Relatively secure and computationally efficient|
|`Rivest–Shamir–Adleman`|`RSA`|Widely used and considered secure, but computationally intensive|
|`Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman`|`ECDH`|Provides enhanced security compared to traditional Diffie-Hellman|
|`Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm`|`ECDSA`|Provides enhanced security and efficiency for digital signature generation|

#### Internet Key Exchange

1. protocol used to establish and maintain secure communication sessions. (mostly used in VPN)
2. it uses combination of `Diffie-Hellman` key exchange and other cryptographic techniques.
3. Can be used for authentication of users and devices.
4. IKE operates either in `main mode` or `aggressive mode` and this determines the sequence and parameter of key exchange process.

- Main mode 
	- default mode and consider more secure.
	- key exchange process is performed in three phases.
- Aggressive mode
	- faster performance by reducing the number of round trips and message exchanges required for key exchange.
	- exchange process performed in two phases.


## Authentication Protocols

commonly used auth protocol 

|**Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Kerberos`|Key Distribution Center (KDC) based authentication protocol that uses tickets in domain environments.|
|`SRP`|This is a password-based authentication protocol that uses cryptography to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.|
|`SSL`|A cryptographic protocol used for secure communication over a computer network.|
|`TLS`|TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the internet. It is the successor to SSL.|
|`OAuth`|An open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party access to their web resources without sharing their passwords.|
|`OpenID`|OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to use a single identity to sign in to multiple websites.|
|`SAML`|Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based standard for securely exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.|
|`2FA`|An authentication method that uses a combination of two different factors to verify a user's identity.|
|`FIDO`|The Fast IDentity Online Alliance is a consortium of companies working to develop open standards for strong authentication.|
|`PKI`|PKI is a system for securely exchanging information based on the use of public and private keys for encryption and digital signatures.|
|`SSO`|An authentication method that allows a user to use a single set of credentials to access multiple applications.|
|`MFA`|MFA is an authentication method that uses multiple factors, such as something the user knows (a password), something the user has (a phone), or something the user is (biometric data), to verify their identity.|
|`PAP`|A simple authentication protocol that sends a user's password in clear text over the network.|
|`CHAP`|An authentication protocol that uses a three-way handshake to verify a user's identity.|
|`EAP`|A framework for supporting multiple authentication methods, allowing for the use of various technologies to verify a user's identity.|
|`SSH`|This is a network protocol for secure communication between a client and a server. We can use it for remote command-line access and remote command execution, as well as for secure file transfer. SSH uses encryption to protect against eavesdropping and other attacks and can also be used for authentication.|
|`HTTPS`|This is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for communication on the internet. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication and provide authentication, ensuring that third parties cannot intercept and read the transmitted data. It is widely used for secure communication over the internet, particularly for web browsing.|
|`LEAP`|LEAP is a wireless authentication protocol developed by Cisco. It uses EAP to provide mutual authentication between a wireless client and a server and uses the RC4 encryption algorithm to encrypt communication between the two. Unfortunately, LEAP is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and other security vulnerabilities and has been largely replaced by more secure protocols such as EAP-TLS and PEAP.|
|`PEAP`|PEAP on the other hand is a secure tunneling protocol used for wireless and wired networks. It is based on EAP and uses TLS to encrypt communication between a client and a server. PEAP uses a server-side certificate to authenticate the server and can also be used to authenticate the client using various methods, such as passwords, certificates, or biometric data. PEAP is widely used in enterprise networks for secure authentication.|

## TCP/UDP connections

- Both TCP and UDP used in information and data transmission on the internet.


| TCP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | UDP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TCP` is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures that all data sent from one computer to another is received.                                                                                                                    | `UDP`, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol. It is used when speed is more important than reliability, such as for video streaming or online gaming.                                                                                                                                          |
| If an error occurs while sending data, the receiver sends a message back so the sender can resend the missing data. This makes `TCP` reliable and slower than UDP because more time is required for transmission and error recovery. | With `UDP`, there is no verification that the received data is complete and error-free. If an error occurs while sending data, the receiver will not receive this missing data, and no message will be sent back to resend it. Some data may be lost with `UDP`, but the overall transmission is faster. |

#### IP Packet

An [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (`IP`) packet is the data area used by the network layer of the [Open Systems Interconnection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (`OSI`) model to transmit data from one computer to another. It consists of a header and the payload, the actual payload data

The header of an IP packet contains several fields that have important information.

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Version`|Indicates which version of the IP protocol is being used|
|`Internet Header Length`|Indicates the size of the header in 32-bit words|
|`Class of Service`|Means how important the transmission of the data is|
|`Total length`|Specifies the total length of the packet in bytes|
|`Identification (ID)`|Is used to identify fragments of the packet when fragmented into smaller parts|
|`Flags`|Used to indicate fragmentation|
|`Fragment Offset`|Indicates where the current fragment is placed in the packet|
|`Time to Live`|Specifies how long the packet may remain on the network|
|`Protocol`|Specifies which protocol is used to transmit the data, such as TCP or UDP|
|`Checksum`|Is used to detect errors in the header|
|`Source/Destination`|Indicate where the packet was sent from and where it is being sent to|
|`Options`|Contain optional information for routing|
|`Padding`|Pads the packet to a full word length|

#### IP Record-Route Field

- The `Record-Route field` in the IP header also records the route to a destination device. 
- When the destination device sends back the `ICMP Echo Reply` packet, the IP addresses of all devices that pass through the packet are listed in the `Record-Route field` of the IP header.

#### IP Payload

The IP payload refers to the actual data being carried within an Internet Protocol (IP) packet. The IP packet consists of a header and a payload.

#### TCP

- also know as segment, divided into several sections called headers and payloads.
- tcp segment wrapped in IP packet.

#### UDP

- datagrams (small data packets)

#### Blind spoofing

- attacker sends false information on a network without seeing the actual responses sent back by the target devices. It involves manipulating the IP header field to indicate false source and destination addresses. For example, we send a TCP packet to the target host with false source and destination port numbers and a false `Initial Sequence Number` (`ISN`). The `ISN` is a field in the TCP header that is used to specify the sequence number of the first TCP packet in a connection. The ISN is set by the sender of a TCP packet and sent to the receiver in the TCP header of the first packet. This can cause the target host to establish a connection with us without receiving the connection.

This attack is commonly used to disrupt the integrity of network connections or to break connections between network devices. It can also be used to monitor network traffic or to intercept information sent by network devices.

## Cryptography


#### symmetric encryption

- uses same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- AES and DES are examples of symmetric encryption.
- used to encrypt large data.

#### Asymetric encryption

- also know as public-key encryption
- uses two different key. 
	- public key : used to encrypt the data
	- private key : used to decrypt the data.
- RSA, PGP (Pretty good privacy) and ECC (Elliptic curve cryptography)

#### Cipher mode

- refers to how a block cipher algorithm encrypts a plaintext message.

|**Cipher Mode**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[Electronic Code Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) (`ECB`) mode|ECB mode is generally not recommended for use due to its susceptibility to certain types of attacks. Furthermore, it does not hide data patterns efficiently. As a result, statistical analysis can reveal elements of clear-text messages, for example, in web applications.|
|[Cipher Block Chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC) (`CBC`) mode|CBC mode is generally used to encrypt messages like disk encryption and e-mail communication. This is the default mode for AES and is also used in software like TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, TLS, and SSL.|
|[Cipher Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_feedback_(CFB)) (`CFB`) mode|CFB mode is well suited for real-time encryption of a data stream, e.g., network communication encryption or encryption/decryption of files in transit like Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) and Microsoft's BitLocker.|
|[Output Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#OFB) (`OFB`) mode|OFB mode is also used to encrypt a data stream, e.g., to encrypt real-time communication. However, this mode is considered better for the data stream because of how the key stream is generated. We can find this mode in PKCS but also in the SSH protocol.|
|[Counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CTR) (`CTR`) mode|CTR mode encrypts real-time data streams AES uses, e.g., network communication, disk encryption, and other real-time scenarios where data is processed. An example of this would be IPsec or Microsoft's BitLocker.|
|[Galois/Counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) (`GCM`) mode|GCM is used in cases where confidentiality and integrity need to be protected together, such as wireless communications, VPNs, and other secure communication protocols.|
