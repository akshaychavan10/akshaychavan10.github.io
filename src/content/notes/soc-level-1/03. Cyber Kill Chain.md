## Introduction

**kill chain** : its Military concept related to the structure of an attack.

**Cyber kill chain** :

- developed by Lockheed Martin company for the cyber security industry based on military concept.
- It helps to understand and protect against ransomware attackes, security breaches as well as APTs.
- used to assess network and system security by identify missing security controls & closing certain security gapsbased on comapny infrastructure.

**Attack phases in Cyber kill chain**

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command & control
7. Action on Objectives.

## Reconnaissance

- Discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim.
- OSINT also falls under recon.
- The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for recon. for example :

    - [https://hunter.io/](https://hunter.io/)
    - [https://osintframework.com/](https://osintframework.com/)

## Weaponization

**Weaponizer** combines malware and exploit into a deliverable payload.

- **Malware** is a program or software that is designed to damage,disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a computer
- An **Exploit** is a program or a code that takes advantages of the vulnerability or flaw in the applications or system.
- A **Payload** is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system.

## Delivery

The delivery phase when attacker choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. Example :

- Phishing Email
- infected USB drives

## Exploitation

The malware is triggered, exploiting a vulnerability in the target’s system

## Installation

- Once attacker gets access to the system, he would want to reaccess the system if he loses the connection to it or system gets patched.
- Attacker use **Persistent Backdoor.** A persistent backdoor allows attacker to access system comprimised in past. Its achieved by
    - installing web shell on the server.
    - installing a backdoor using Meterpreter.
    - Creating or modifying windows services. (T1543.003 on MITRE ATT&CK)

## Command & Control

The attacker establishes communication between the compromised system and their server, enabling remote control of the infected machine.

## Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)

Attackers achieve their goals, which may include data exfiltration, system damage, or further network intrusion to compromise more assets.

## Summary

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework used to understand the stages of a cyberattack and how attackers can be stopped at each stage. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the model outlines the steps cybercriminals typically follow when executing a successful cyber intrusion. It helps organizations understand attack strategies and develop defenses against them. The stages of the Cyber Kill Chain are:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Attackers gather information about the target. This may include scanning for vulnerabilities, studying employees, and collecting data from public sources.
2. **Weaponization**: Attackers create malicious payloads (e.g., malware) designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities identified in the reconnaissance phase. This may involve combining an exploit with a backdoor or virus.
3. **Delivery**: The attacker sends the weaponized payload to the target. Common delivery methods include phishing emails, infected websites, or USB drives.
4. **Exploitation**: The malware is triggered, exploiting a vulnerability in the target’s system (e.g., executing malicious code or running a macro).
5. **Installation**: The malware installs itself on the victim's system, giving attackers control over the environment.
6. **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker establishes communication between the compromised system and their server, enabling remote control of the infected machine.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: Attackers achieve their goals, which may include data exfiltration, system damage, or further network intrusion to compromise more assets.
