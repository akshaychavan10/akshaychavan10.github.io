## Threat Modelling

Threat modelling involves identifying potential vulnerabilities and then putting in the counter measures and control in place so those vulnerabilities are not exploited.

- **Threat** : Anything that could potentially cause harm to an organization’s assets,data, or operations by exploiting a vulnerability.

## Unified Kill Chain

Unified kill chain has 18 phases :

|#|Phase|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Reconnaissance|Researching, identifying, and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.|
|2|Weaponization|Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack.|
|3|Delivery|Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.|
|4|Social Engineering|Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.|
|5|Exploitation|Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, among others, result in code execution.|
|6|Persistence|Any access, action, or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.|
|7|Defense Evasion|Techniques an attacker may use for evading detection or avoiding defenses.|
|8|Command & Control|Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.|
|9|Pivoting|Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.|
|10|Discovery|Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.|
|11|Privilege Escalation|Techniques providing an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.|
|12|Execution|Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.|
|13|Credential Access|Techniques resulting in the access of system, service, or domain credentials.|
|14|Lateral Movement|Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.|
|15|Collection|Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.|
|16|Exfiltration|Techniques that result in or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.|
|17|Impact|Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting, or destroying the target system or data.|
|18|Objectives|Socio-technical objectives of an attack that are intended to achieve a strategic goal.|

## Breakdown of the Unified Kill Chain

It is structured into three main phases that details how attacker might penetrate and execute their objectives :

1. **Initial Foothold** - How Attackers gain entry into a system.
2. **Network Propagation** - How attackers move laterally across systems after gaining access.
3. **Actions on Objectives** - How attackers achieve their ultimate goals, such as data theft, system disruption,etc.

### Initial Foothold

- **Reconnaissance** – Attackers gather intelligence on the target (e.g., employees, network architecture).
- **Weaponization** – Creating malicious tools like malware.
- **Delivery** – Sending the malicious payload (e.g., phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities).
- **Social Engineering** – Manipulating individuals to gain access.
- **Exploitation** – Leveraging vulnerabilities to execute malicious code.
- **Installation** – Installing malware or backdoors.
- **Command and Control (C2)** – Establishing a communication channel for remote control of compromised systems.

### Network Propagation

- **Privilege Escalation** – Gaining higher privileges to access more sensitive data or systems.
- **Defense Evasion** – Avoiding detection by security systems.
- **Credential Access** – Stealing user credentials to gain further access.
- **Lateral Movement** – Moving across networked systems to reach more valuable assets.
- **Collection** – Gathering the data or information targeted by the attack.
- **Persistence** – Establishing a long-term foothold in the system to maintain access.

### Actions on Objects

- **Execution** – Running malicious code to achieve goals.
- **Exfiltration** – Stealing data from the compromised systems.
- **Impact** – Causing damage, either by manipulating, destroying, or denying access to data.
- **Evasion of Attribution** – Hiding the source of the attack, making it difficult to trace.
- **Retreat** – Covering tracks and safely withdrawing from the compromised systems.
