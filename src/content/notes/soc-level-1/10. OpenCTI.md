## Introduction

**Notes cover** :

- What is OpenCTI and how is it used ?
- How to navigate through the platform.
- what functionalities will be important during a security threat analysis ?

### OpenCTI

- Platform for CTI (cyber threat intel).
- Collect, input, store, manage and share **Threat Intel** data.
- It can be integrated to other CTI tools such as `MISP` , `TheHive` and framework such as `MITRE ATT&CK`.

## OpenCTI Data Model

**STIX2 Standard**

- main data structure used in OpenCTI. allows create _entries_ (like threat,vulnerabilities etc) and _relationship_ (connection between those entries, Eg: which threat actor is associated with which malware)

### Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend (React & GraphQL)**
    1. React : Used for UI of the platform.
    2. GraphQL API : core of communication between frontend,backend and database. It ensure that clients (the frontend and external services) can query the data efficiently.
2. **Database**
    1. The primary storage system where all the data is saved and retrieved for use in threat intelligence analysis.
3. **Event Stream(Redis)**
    1. Redis is able to handle large ammount of real-time data.
    2. Redis is used as a **streaming platform**, where events (data streams) are processed in real time. This allows OpenCTI to handle large volumes of data and notifications efficiently.
4. **Storage(MinIO)**
    1. Used for storing large files like reports,documens and other kind of CTI data.
5. **Connectors**
    1. Either ingest new data into OpenCTI or enrich and export data.
    2. Classifications :
        1. External Input Connectors : ingest data from external sources (CVE, MISP, MITRE)
        2. Stream Connectors : Consume data stream from the platform.
        3. Internal Enrichment Connectors : Enrich the data within OpenCTI by adding more details to existing entities (e.g., enriching a vulnerability with more details).
        4. Internal Import File Connectors : Extract data from uploaded reports (PDFs, STIX2)
        5. Internal Export File Connectos : Export data from openCTI into formats.
6. **Messaging System(RabbitMQ)**
    1. When different parts of the system (like connectors and workers) need to communicate they send message through RabbitMQ.
    2. handles Asynchronous messaging.
7. **Workers**
    1. These are **Python processes** that consume and process data from the **RabbitMQ messaging system**. Workers help to **consume messages** from the queue and process them
    2. In other words wait for tasks(messages) from RabbitMQ. when they get task, they “work” on it like saving data to the database or sending an alert.

## Dashboard

- Dashboard showcase various visual widgets summarizing the threat data ingested into openCTI.
- It highlights the current status of various entities, including the total number of entities, relationships, reports, observables, and any changes to these properties within the last 24 hours.
- The OpenCTI dashboard is a central hub that summarizes and presents key threat intelligence data through various visual widgets. These widgets provide an overview of the total number of entities, reports, relationships, and observables ingested, including recent changes.

### Activities

Content Information about threat.

- **Analysis**: Focuses on reports that analyze input entities and their external references. Analysts can investigate threats and add notes to enrich knowledge.
- **Events**: Used by analysts to track and investigate suspicious activities within an organization's network, documenting their findings and associating incidents with relevant data. here we register and handle event which is occurs locally(in organisation).
- **Observations**: Lists technical elements, detection rules, and artefacts discovered during cyber incidents, helping analysts correlate events with threat intelligence.

### Knowledge

- **Threats**: Includes:
    - **Threat Actors**: Individuals or groups launching attacks.
    - **Intrusion Sets**: Sets of TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures) and tools used by attackers.
    - **Campaigns**: Coordinated series of attacks targeting specific entities.
- **Arsenal**: Includes items used in attacks such as malware, attack patterns, and vulnerabilities:
    - **Malware**: Lists active malware along with detailed associations.
    - **Attack Patterns**: Shows techniques used by adversaries.
    - **Courses of Action (CoA)**: Defensive strategies to mitigate attack techniques.
    - **Tools**: Legitimate tools that could be exploited by adversaries.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: Lists system weaknesses exploitable by attackers, enriched by the CVE list.
- **Entities**
    - Categorizes entities by sectors, countries, organizations, and individuals, allowing analysts to enrich their knowledge on various attacks and organizations.
