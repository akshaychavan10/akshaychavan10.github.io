## Introduction to IPS/IDS

**IDS** : Detect possible malicious activities/pattern , responsible for generating alert.

_Types of IDS_

- NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) : monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network, if a signature identified , an alert is created.
- HIDS(Host based Intrusion Detection system) : Monitor traffic flow from single endpoint device.Aim is to investigate traffic on a particular device. if a signature is identified, an alert is created.

**IPS** : Prevent possible malicious activities/patterns. responsible for stopping/preventing/terminating suspicious event.

_Types of IPS_

1. NIPS(network ips) : NIPS monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network. if a signature is identified, the connection is terminated.
2. NBA(Network Behavious Analysis) : works same as NIPS the only difference is behaviour based systems require a training period (also known as "baselining") to learn the normal traffic and differentiate the malicious traffic and threats. This model provides more efficient results against new threats.
3. WIPS(Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) : Monitor traffic flow from wireless network. if signature identified the connection is terminated.
4. HIPS(Host based intrusion prevention system) : monitor traffic flow from a single endpoint device. if signature matched , connection is terminated.

**Detection and Prevention Techniques**

- Signature Based : relies on rules.
- Behaviour Based : The model compares the normal with abnormal behavious. help to identifies new threat with new patterns.
- Policy-Based : compares detected activities with system configuration and security policies.

### **1. Installing Snort**

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort
```

During installation, you'll be asked to configure Snort with the network address range (HOME_NET) it should monitor. You can skip this and configure it later.

**On CentOS/Fedora:**

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install snort
```

---

### **2. Configuring Snort**

The configuration file for Snort is usually located at `/etc/snort/snort.conf`. In this file, you'll need to configure your network variables and rules:

### **a. Set HOME_NET**

In the configuration file, set your `HOME_NET` variable to define the network range Snort should monitor. Example:

```bash
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
```

### **b. Enable Rules**

Snort uses rules to detect attacks. These rules are stored in the `/etc/snort/rules/` directory. Snort comes with default rules, but you can add more by downloading updated rules from **Snort’s official website** (requires registration).

To enable a rule in `snort.conf`, uncomment or add the rule file:

```bash
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
```

You can define rules in `local.rules`

---

### **3. Running Snort in Different Modes**

Snort can be run in multiple modes depending on what you need it to do:

### **a. Sniffer Mode**

Sniffer mode simply prints out the packets that are captured on the specified network interface. This is the most basic mode for Snort.

Sniffer mode is used to **capture and display network packets in real-time** as they are transmitted across the network.

```bash
snort -i <interface> -v
```

- `i <interface>`: This specifies the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
- `v`: Verbose mode; it prints packet information.

Example:

```bash
snort -i eth0 -v
```

### **b. Packet Logger Mode**

In this mode, Snort logs packets to a directory that you specify. This is useful for forensic analysis of packet data.

Packet Logger mode is used to **capture and save network packets** to a file or directory for later analysis.

```bash
snort -i <interface> -l <log_directory>
```

Example:

```bash
snort -i eth0 -l /var/log/snort/
```

### **c. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Mode**

This is the mode in which Snort is most commonly used. It compares network traffic against a set of rules and generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

```bash
snort -i <interface> -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

- `c /etc/snort/snort.conf`: Use the Snort configuration file to specify which rules to apply.

Example:

```bash
snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

---

### **4. Writing Basic Snort Rules**

Snort rules are used to define what types of traffic Snort should detect and respond to. Rules are written in the following format:

```bash
action protocol source_ip source_port -> destination_ip destination_port (options)
```

### **Example:**

```bash
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"HTTP traffic detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

This rule alerts when it detects **TCP** traffic going to port 80 (HTTP) from any IP address.

- `alert`: Action to take (e.g., alert, log, pass).
- `tcp`: The protocol (can be `udp`, `icmp`, etc.).
- `any any`: Traffic coming from any IP address and any port.
- `>`: Direction of traffic.
- `any 80`: Traffic going to any IP but on port 80.
- `msg`: The message to log when the rule triggers.
- `sid`: The rule’s unique ID (must be unique for each rule).
- `rev`: The revision number of the rule.

You can save this rule in the `local.rules` file located in `/etc/snort/rules/`.

we can use [http://www.cyb3rs3c.net/](http://www.cyb3rs3c.net/) to write rules.

### **5. Testing Snort with PCAP Files**

You can use PCAP files to simulate real traffic and test Snort’s detection capabilities:

```bash
snort -r <pcap_file> -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort -A console
```

This command reads (`-r`)a PCAP file and uses the Snort configuration file( `-c` ) to apply the rules. Any alerts are logged to (`-l`) the `/var/log/snort/` directory and printed to the console(`-A`).

---

### **6. Checking Alerts**

After running Snort in IDS mode, you can check alerts generated by Snort. Alerts are logged in the `/var/log/snort/alert` file by default. You can view them with:

```bash
cat /var/log/snort/alert
```

The alerts include details about the packet and which rule triggered the alert.

### **7. Snort with PulledPork**

PulledPork is a script used to automatically update Snort rulesets, ensuring you have the latest detection capabilities. You can download it from the official site and configure it to work with Snort.

To integrate it:

1. Download the PulledPork script from GitHub.
2. Register with **[Snort.org](http://Snort.org)** to get an Oinkcode for downloading rules.
3. Use PulledPork to automate rule updates.

## Note

### Use Case for Large Network.

- Snort runs with the NIC in a promiscuous mode which allows it to see all the traffic on the monitored network.
    - **Promiscuous mode** : The NIC on the snort machine is configured to capture all network traffic , regardless of its destination.

### Snort as an IPS

- snort widely used as **IDS** but can be use as **IPS** also using **Inline mode**.
- To use Snort as an IPS, you need to place it inline with the network traffic so that it can take action (e.g., block malicious traffic).

```bash
snort -Q --daq nfq -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

- `Q`: This runs Snort in inline mode.
- `-daq nfq`: This specifies the **Data Acquisition** library to use. Here, we use **nfqueue** (for Linux systems with iptables) to drop packets
