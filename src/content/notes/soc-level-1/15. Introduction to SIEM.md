- Security Information and Event Management
- Tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place and perform correlation on them.
## Network Visibility through SIEM
- Devices/Network can generate different type of logs, we can divice our log sources into two logical parts : 
	1. Host-Centric Log Sources :  log sources that capture events that occurred within or related to the host. Eg : A user accessing a file, attempting to authenticate, process execution , powershell execution etc.
	2. Network- Centric Log Sources : Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Eg : ssh connection, file being accessed by FTP, web traffic

**important of SIEM**
- Devices generate hundreds of event/logs per second. Examine this logs one by one will be tedious task.
- Its not only takes logs from various sources in real time but also provide ability to correlate between event,search through logs,investigate and respond.

## Log Sources

| Devices            | Log Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows            | `Event Viewer` tool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Linux              | Locations : <br>`/var/log/https` : Contains http Request/Response and error logs.<br>`/var/log/cron` : Events related to cron jobs<br>`/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/secure` : Stores authentication related logs.<br>`/var/log/kern` : Store kernel related events.<br> |
| Web Server (Linux) | `/var/log/apache` or `/var/log/httpd`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
## Log Ingestion
- All this logs can help to identify security issue. 
- Each SIEM solution has its own way of ingesting the logs.
- Some common solutions used by SIEM.

1. **Agent/Forwarder** : Lightweight tool that gets installed in endpoints. configured to capture all the important logs and send them to SIEM server.
2. **Syslog** : Widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc., are sent real-time data to the centralized destination.
3. **Manual Upload** : Some SIEM solutions, like Splunk, ELK, etc., allow users to ingest offline data for quick analysis.
4. **Port-Forwarding** : SIEM solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port, and then the endpoints forward the data to the SIEM instance on the listening port.

## Why SIEM
### SIEM Capabilities
- Correlation between events from different log sources.
- Provide visibility on both Host-centric and Network-centric activities.
- Allow analysts to investigate the latest threats and timely responses.
- Hunt for threats that are not detected by the rules in place.
### SOC Analyst Responsibilities
- Monitoring and Investigating.
- Identifying False positives.
- Tuning Rules which are causing the noise or False positives.
- Reporting and Compliance.
- Identifying blind spots in the network visibility and covering them.

## Analysing Logs and Alerts
- SIEM tool gets all the logs ingested through agent,port forwarding etc.
- then SIEM looks for unwanted behaviour or suspicious pattern within the logs with the help of conditions set in the rules by the analyst.
- if condition is met, a rule gets triggered and the incident is investigated.

### Dashboard
- Each SIEM solution comes with some default dashboards and provides an option for custom Dashboard creation. Some of the information that can be found in a dashboard are:
1. Alert highlight
2. System Notification
3. Health Alert
4. List of Failed Login Attempts
5. Events Ingested Count
6. Rules triggered
7. Top Domains Visited

### Correlation Rules
- Correlation rules are logical expressions set to be triggered.
**Example** :
1. If a User gets 5 failed Login Attempts in 10 seconds - Raise an alert for `Multiple Failed Login Attempts`
2. If login is successful after multiple failed login attempts - Raise an alert for `Successful Login After multiple Login Attempts`
3. A rule is set to alert every time a user plugs in a USB.

### Alert Investigation

Once an alert is triggered, the events/flows associated with the alert are examined, and the rule is checked to see which conditions are met.

Based on the investigation, the analyst determines if it's a True or False positive

Actions that are performed after the analysis are:
- Alert is False Alarm. It may require tuning the rule to avoid similar False positives from occurring again.  
- Alert is True Positive. Perform further investigation.  
- Contact the asset owner to inquire about the activity.
- Suspicious activity is confirmed. Isolate the infected host.
- Block the suspicious IP.
