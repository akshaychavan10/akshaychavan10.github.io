## What is Repeater

Burp Suite Repeater enables us to modify and resend intercepted requests to a target of our choosing. It allows us to take requests captured in the Burp Proxy and manipulate them, sending them repeatedly as needed.

1. **Request List**: At the top left, it shows all Repeater requests, allowing us to handle multiple requests simultaneously. New requests sent to Repeater appear here.
2. **Request Controls**: Below the request list, these controls let us send requests, cancel hanging ones, and navigate through request history.
3. **Request and Response View**: Taking up most of the interface, it displays the Request and Response views. We edit requests in the Request view and view corresponding responses in the Response view.
4. **Layout Options**: At the top-right of the Request/Response view, these options customize the layout (default: side-by-side). We can choose vertical layout or separate tabs.
5. **Inspector**: On the right, it lets us analyze and modify requests more intuitively than the raw editor. We'll delve deeper into this later.
6. **Target**: Above the Inspector, it specifies the target IP or domain for requests. Automatically populated when requests are sent from other Burp Suite components.

## Basic Usage

Once a request has been captured in the Proxy module, we can send it to Repeater by either right-clicking on the request and selecting **Send to Repeater**, or by utilizing the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + R`.

**Pretty**: Default option that enhances readability by slightly formatting the raw response.

**Raw**: Displays the unmodified response directly from the server without extra formatting.

**Hex**: Shows the response in a byte-level representation, useful for binary files.

**Render**: Visualizes the page as it would appear in a web browser, though not commonly used in Repeater. Typically, the Pretty option suffices, but knowing the other options can be beneficial.

**Request Attributes** section, we can alter elements related to the location, method, and protocol of the request.

**Request Query Parameters:** These refer to data sent to the server via the URL. For example, in a GET request like `https://admin.tryhackme.com/?redirect=false`, the query parameter **redirect** has a value of "false".

**Request Body Parameters:** Similar to query parameters, but specific to POST requests. Any data sent as part of a POST request will be displayed in this section, allowing us to modify the parameters before resending.

**Request Cookies:** This section contains a modifiable list of cookies sent with each request.

**Request Headers:** It enables us to view, access, and modify (including adding or removing) any headers sent with our requests. Editing these headers can be valuable when examining how a web server responds to unexpected headers.

**Response Headers:** This section displays the headers returned by the server in response to our request. It cannot be modified, as we have no control over the headers returned by the server.
