## Introduction

Originally know as Ethereal , Wireshark display data from hundreds of different protocols on all major network types.

## Capture data packets

1. Select one or more network interface, go to menu bar then select `Capture`.

> To select mutiple network interface , hold the `Shift` key as you make your selection

2. In the `Wireshark Capture Interface` window , select `Start` .

3. Select **File** > **Save As** or choose an **Export** option to record the capture

4. To stop capturing, press **Ctrl+E**. Or, go to the Wireshark toolbar and select the red **Stop** button that's located next to the shark fin.

## Analyze Packet Contents

We focus on three main Sections :

1. Packet list pane (top section)
2. Packet details pane (middle section)
3. packet bytes pane (bottom section)

![The captured data interface contains three main sections: the packet list pane (the top section); the packet details pane (the middle section); and the packet bytes pane (the bottom section).](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AVc46VsjWU-dnZR7Z0oIHbLal58=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/008_wireshark-tutorial-4143298-7fc1de4be4e746278f59f2179a453528.jpg)


#### Packet List

- located at top windows, show all packet found in the active capture file.
