#### Viewing The Page Source

Viewing the page source can often give us clues into whether a framework is in use and, if so, which framework and even what version. Knowing the framework and version can be a powerful find as there may be public vulnerabilities in the framework, and the website might not be using the most up to date version.

#### Inspector

Browser inspectors are invaluable tools for cybersecurity professionals. They allow you to analyze and manipulate various aspects of web pages, aiding in vulnerability assessment, debugging, and understanding web application behavior. By inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, you can identify security flaws such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure configurations.

#### Debugger

browser debuggers serve as indispensable tools for cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to analyze, diagnose, and mitigate security risks in web applications and defend against evolving threats in the digital landscape.
debuggers concentrate on analyzing and debugging JavaScript code.

#### Network

the network tab in browsers is an indispensable tool for web developers, performance engineers, and cybersecurity professionals, offering comprehensive visibility into network activity and performance characteristics of web pages.
