Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain

## OSINT - SSL/TLS Certificates

SSL/TLS certificates for domains are logged in Certificate Transparency (CT) logs by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to prevent misuse. Tools like https://crt.sh and https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui provide searchable databases of certificates, helping us find subdomains associated with a domain.

Resource : [cert.sh](https://crt.sh)

## OSINT -Search Engines

Search engines like Google index trillions of links to over a billion websites, offering a vast resource for discovering subdomains. Utilizing advanced search techniques, such as the site: filter, can refine results. 

## DNS Bruteforce

Bruteforce DNS enumeration involves trying numerous potential subdomains from a list. To expedite this process, we automate it with tools like dnsrecon.

## Virtual Hosts 

Some subdomains, like development versions or admin portals, might not be publicly accessible in DNS results. They could be stored on a private DNS server or in the developer's local hosts file, mapping domain names to IP addresses.

Web servers can host multiple websites on one server. When a client requests a website, the server identifies it via the Host header. By modifying this header and observing the response, we can potentially uncover new websites.

We can use `ffuf` to find virtual host.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H “Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm” -u http://MACHINE_IP -fs {size}
```
