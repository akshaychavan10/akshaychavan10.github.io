## What is an IDOR ?

IDOR, or Insecure Direct Object Reference, is an access control vulnerability where user input is used to access objects on a web server without proper validation, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Example : `http://online-service.com/profile?user_id=305`

## Finding IDORS in

### In Encoded IDs

When transferring data between pages using methods like post data, query strings, or cookies, developers typically encode the raw data to ensure compatibility and understanding by the receiving web server. you can decode the data by decoding techniques (eg : base64) then edit the data and re-encode it to submit request.

### In Hashed IDs

Hashed IDs are more complex than encoded ones and might follow a predictable pattern, like being the hashed version of an integer value. For instance, the ID number 123 could become 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70 if using MD5 hashing.

You can use [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net) to crack some of this hash.

### In Unpredictable IDs

If you cant find ID publicly then you can create two accounts and swap ID numbers between them. If you can access the other user's content using their ID while logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), it indicates a valid IDOR vulnerability.

## Where are IDORS Located ?

The vulnerable endpoint you're targeting might not always be visible in the address bar. It could be content loaded by your browser through AJAX requests or referenced in a JavaScript file.

Sometimes endpoints have unreferenced parameters that were useful during development but unintentionally pushed to production.

For instance, while authenticated, you might see `/user/details` showing your info. But through parameter mining, you find a `user_id` parameter that lets you access other users info, like `/user/details?user_id=123`.
