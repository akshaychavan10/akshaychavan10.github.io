## Introduction

> What is File Inclusion ?
> It is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application dynamically includes a file based on user input.The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated.

## Path Traversal

Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, is a web security vulnerability that enables attackers to access files or directories outside the web application's root directory. Attackers exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the application's URL to read operating system resources, like local files on the server.

Attacker take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots `../../` If the attacker finds the entry point.

Similarly, if the web application runs on a Windows server, the attacker needs to provide Windows paths. 

```cmd
http://192.168.1.109/get.php?file=../../../boot.ini
```

## Local File Inclusion - LFI :

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files residing on the server through the web application. By manipulating input parameters that reference local files, attackers can read sensitive files, execute malicious code, or even compromise the server's security.

The attacker can read sensitive files, execute malicious code, or access restricted resources.

> LFI focuses on including local files directly into the application, while Directory Traversal focuses on navigating through directories to access files outside the application's root directory.

Example :

```bash
http://webapp.com/index.php?lagn=languages/EN.php to exploit this we can craft payload like : ?lang=languages/../../../../etc/passwd
```

## Remote File Inclusion - RFI

This occurs when an attacker is able to include a remote file (usually from a malicious external server) into the web application. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, such as shell commands or malicious scripts, on the server.

## Remediation

1. **Keep systems and services updated**: Regularly update all system components, including web application frameworks, to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    
2. **Disable PHP errors**: Turn off PHP error messages to prevent leaking sensitive information, like the path of the application, which could aid attackers.
    
3. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Implement a WAF to help mitigate web application attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
    
4. **Disable unnecessary PHP features**: Disable PHP features that may introduce file inclusion vulnerabilities, such as allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include, if they are not needed for your web application.
    
5. **Carefully analyze web application inputs**: Never trust user input and ensure proper input validation to prevent file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    
6. **Implement whitelisting and blacklisting**: Use whitelisting to allow only specific protocols and PHP wrappers that are necessary for your application, and consider blacklisting to restrict unauthorized access to certain file names and locations.
